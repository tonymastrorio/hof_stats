# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
    - I created a CLI that first displays a list of all of the members of the MLB hall of fame along with the year they were voted in, how many votes they received, etc. Then, users are allowed to select a player by line number to view career statistics about each player.

- [x] Pull data from an external source
    - I am scraping data from the website www.baseball-reference.com.

- [x] Implement both list and detail views
    - The list view shows a list of all players in the hall of fame upon running the app.  Then, a user can view the detail view for any player by typing their line number.  The detail view shows statistics such as career hits, home runs, and batting average for position players, and pitching statistics for pitchers.
